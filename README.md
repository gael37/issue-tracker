Web app called Issue Tracker using Next.js, deployed on Vercel.

## What it does:
Enables a team to work on issues by:

-Creating, updating, deleting, assigning issues

-Viewing stats on issues handling

## This project was built using the following technologies:

-Next.js

-TypeScript

-Prisma

-MySQL

-RadixUI

-Tailwind

## Notes

### Regarding authentication

I used NextAuth. 
Users can login with credentials or Google.
I was unsatisfied with the user experience of bare NextAuth login page so I customised it using a simple React Form component.

### Regarding UX/UI

I tried to implement as many loading spinners/skeletons as I could and the app is fully responsive.

## Why this project? Challenges?

I built this app to familiarize myself with technologies that I never worked on, with including Next.js, TypeScript, Authentication library, Tailwind, UI library, MySQL, Prisma.
It was a challenge to discover and work on all of these new tools at once, and I learnt a lot from it.
I won't touch this project again, it was for practice purposes.
My next project will use Next.js and TypeScript again so I can practice deeper.
